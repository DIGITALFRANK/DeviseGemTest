Here we will be taking different steps to play and with and test the Devise Gem.
How far can we push it regarding User Authentication, Security, and even a little bit of Authorization functions

A few things we will cover & test:

* Creating Devise models & migrations

* Adding Devise to an existing User model

* Automatically generate password for users (simpler registration)

* Retain User Data after account Delete (soft delete)

* Use Omniauth in a localized scope

* OmniAuth: Testing

* Redirect to a specific page on successful sign in and sign out

* Add an Admin role

* Add a default role to a User

* Send emails in background (Resque, Sidekiq and Delayed::Job)

* AWS Cognito Federated Identity Authentication

* ...
